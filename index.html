                    <p>I was born and raised in Serbia. I graduated from the University of Belgrade, I have a master&apos;s degree in geography and spatial planning. It was something I wanted to do as a job, but the circumstances of my life decided differently. I worked for 5 years at Belgrade airport as a home stewardess, after which I left my job to move to Germany. I&apos;ve been living in Germany for last three years. I am currently studying web development and I want it to be my future career.</p>
                    <p>I&apos;m a life enthusiast and a dreamer, I live everyday with gratitude and no expectation! I love my family, my little animal kingdom, yoga, healthy food, traveling..!</p>
                    <p>I started my yoga journey at a stressful period of my life, in 2019 and this was the best decision that helped me on my way to healing, which continues to this day...!
