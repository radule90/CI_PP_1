                    <h2 class="subheading">Hi! My name is Milica</h2>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Serbia. I graduated from the University of Belgrade, I have a master&apos;s degree in geography and spatial planning. It was something I wanted to do as a job, but the circumstances of my life decided differently. I worked for 5 years at Belgrade airport as a home stewardess, after which I left my job to move to Germany. I&apos;ve been living in Germany for last three years. I am currently studying web development and I want it to be my future career.</p>
                    <p>I&apos;m a life enthusiast and a dreamer, I live everyday with gratitude and no expectation! I love my family, my little animal kingdom, yoga, healthy food, traveling..!</p>
                    <p>I started my yoga journey at a stressful period of my life, in 2019 and this was the best decision that helped me on my way to healing, which continues to this day...!

                        <p>My wish has been for years to visit two or more (as many as possible) small Cycladic islands in a row, but circumstances have not yet allowed me to do so. But here we are, last summer I had the opportunity to fulfill at least a part of that dream and visit one for the first time, Serifos.</p>
                        <p>It is a small island with some of the most beautiful beaches found on the Aegean Sea coast The island villages have been built in traditional Cycladic style, following the local architectur The old small houses in white-washed color, with blue window frames give a special charm to this magical place.</p>
                        <p>Although I have never visited the typical, fancy islands like Santorini and Mykonos (and I believe they are amazingly beautiful), I am somehow convinced that I would always choose to visit the smaller ones. The main reason is that the smaller islands are quieter, not noisy and overcrowded with tourists, with non-dazzling white houses, freshly painted for the needs of high tourism like in Santorini etc.</p>
                        <p>In Serifos, you can simply feel that local spirit, pthe domestic atmosphere, you simply have that magical feeling as if you were in the &apos;60s and &apos;70s of the last century. Peace, presence of local tourists with a small number of foreign tourists, old houses, simplicity of unique architecture, unorganized beaches with tree lines as a natural shelter from the sun free for everyone, greek tourists with sunbeds and chairs spread out...</p>
                        <p>Huge advantages: the island is small, very well connected by bus lines. Almost every beautiful beach can be reached by mini-bus or even better for a more active vacation, on foot. The beaches are free, you can find your place under a tree and enjoy your privacy. And yes, I could practice yoga and perform yoga poses anywhere.</p>
                        <p>I really enjoyed Serifos and I wouldn&apos;t mind spending the rest of my life there.</p>

                        <h3 class="article-heading">Positano</h3>
                        <p>My sister&apos;s great dream to visit the postcard village of Positano in Italy became a reality last summer. It was not my dream destination but I was so excited to see that famous village dramatically set between rocks and surrounded by the Tyrrhenian sea.</p>
                        <p>So, we packed our bags and flew to Naples at the end of June. It took us about one and half hour to get to Positano by taxi.</p>
                        <p>The taxi driver started his story about this village, and one of the things he repeated several times that the only flat thing in Positano is actually the sea. At first this wasn&apos;t very clear to me, but not long after I realized what the guy wanted to say. If you want to walk and explore and actually get to know Positano, you&apos;ll have to move all the time, either uphill or downhill, with stairs and narrow roads. So, the great adventure was on the horizon!</p>
                        <p>When we arrived at the hotel, we didn&apos;t want to waste a lot of time, we were very excited to go down to the sun-bleached beach where terracotta houses plunge into the turquoise sea.</p>
                        <p>And yes, I must say that this scenery left us breathless! This small cliffside village on Mediterranean Sea is pure magic. Simply, wherever you turn your view, there is an authentic beauty that cannot be described in words. The best thing is that the commercial part (caffes, restaurants, hotels) is beautifully blended in nature and architecture. Nothing sticks out and, well, eh, I suppose it&apos;s Italy! Every corner is breathtaking. Even, all those postcards cannot convey this beauty.</p>
                        <p>During our 12 days stay we visited Amalfi city, Sorrento, Fiore di Furore beach, the famous island of Capri, and we spent the last 2 days of our stay in Italy in Naples.</p>
                        <p>However, I have to mention the only negative thing during our stay in this magical place, and that is mass tourism. Too many tourists, you can&apos;t even normally walk around the streets. The beaches were crowded with people, so my idea of relaxing and practicing yoga on the beach was difficult to achieve. But somehow I managed and took some epic pictures on the beach with mesmerizing view.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, mass tourism in such a small area destroys its domestic atmosphere and abuses such a wonderful nature.</p>
                        <p>If you are curious if Positano is expensive, my answer is: Ohhh, Yes!</p>
                        <p>Since I&apos;m a foodie, I couldn&apos;t wait to try all those lemon delicacies, which is one of the symbols of this part of Italy. Don&apos;t miss to try: Delizia al Limone, Granita di Limone, Cornetto al Limone, Brioche with some delicious Italian cappuccino, and yes the best Lemon Spritz! And I almost forgot, I ate the best pizza in my life in Naples!</p>
                        <p>I could go on writing and writing about Positano. Many have written better than me but I&apos;ll stop here. Just go and live it!</p>
                        <p>All in all, my conclusion is that I would definitely come back to this part of Italy and explore the surrounding places. But definitely, off the season!</p>
                        <p>This village is divine, unique, it leaves you breathless and definitely worth visiting despite the mentioned difficulties. If you have any question, if you are curious to know more, please feel free to connect with me.</p>

                        <p>We went on a road trip to Belgium last October, a three days adventure. The idea was to stay in Ostend, a small place by the sea, and from there to visit the nearby cities like: Bruges, Calais, Ghent.</p>
                        <p>I love Ostend because it has a long, wide beach, which is quiet, mostly empty in the off-season, there are only a few people walking the dog, relaxing or jogging.</p>
                        <p>Of course, as soon as we reached the beach, i was immediately inspired, my passion was awakening and i found myself doing a quick warm up before taking a few yoga pictures for my instagram. We were always in hurry to get and other things done (visit other towns, do shopping and always eat a good waffle). Every morning, before visiting nearby places we were walking by the sea, hoping to see a seal resting on the shore, but every day without success until the last day, when we finaly got lucky. I think we spent half an hour watching her get into the water, playing, swiming, then resting on the shore.</p>

                        <p>Bruges is a small city of the province of West Flanders in the Flemish Region of Belgium, in the northwest of the country. The fairytale city is known for its winding canals, chocolatiers with the most delicious chocolate, the smell of waffles that wafts from everywhere...</p>
                        <p>Bruges is a place that lives and breathes history. Bruges is one of Europe&apos;s best-preserved cities. Visiting this historic place means travelling back in time to the Middle Ages.</p>
                        <p>We spontaneously joined the city tour and heard a lot of interesting things. Of course, we visited the must-see chocolatiers and tasted real Belgian chocolate and famous macarons.</p>
                        <p>The next day destinations were Dunkirk and Calais, small towns in France, right on the border with Belgium. We arrived a little later, walked around towns and then went to see sunset on the Calais beach. Of course, a strong call of nature was there again... Magic always happens when yoga meets a beautiful place. Once again i had amazing photos. Those of the beach golden hour.</p>
                        <p>On the third day we packed up, headed to Ghent where we spent a couple of hours and then back home.</p>
                        <p>Ghent is like a much bigger Bruges. This charming city has wonderful architecture, almost every building catches your eye and takes your breath away, wide channels, important history... We didn&apos;t have much time to spend and explore more, but I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be back.</p>
