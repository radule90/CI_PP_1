                        Hi! My name is Milica, I was born and raised in Serbia. I graduated
                        from the University of Belgrade, with a Master's degree in geography
                        and spatial planning. It was something I wanted to do as a job , but
                        the circumstances of my life decided differently. I worked for 5
                        years at Belgrade airport as a home stewardess, after which I left
                        my job to move to Germany. I've been living in Germany for last
                        three years. I am currently studying web development and I want it
                        to be my future career.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I'm a life enthusiast and a dreamer, I live everyday with gratitude
                        and no expectation! I love my family, my little animal kingdom,
                        yoga, healthy food, traveling..!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I started my yoga journey at a stressful period of my life, in 2019
                        and this was the best decision that helped me on my way to healing,
                        which continues to this day...!
                      </p>

                        <p>
                            My wish has been for years to visit two or more ( as many as
                            possible ) small Cycladic islands in a row, but circumstances have
                            not yet allowed me to do so. But here we are, last summer I had the
                            opportunity to fulfill at least a part of that dream and visit one
                            for the first time, Serifos.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            It is a small island with some of the most beautiful beaches found
                            on the Aegean Sea coast. The island villages have been built in
                            traditional Cycladic style, following the local architectur. The old
                            small houses in white-washed color, with blue window frames give a
                            special charm to this magical place.
                          </p>
                         <p>Just some of many huge advantages of this paradise:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>The island is small, very well connected by bus lines.</li>
                            <li>
                              Almost every beautiful beach can be reached by mini-bus or even
                              better for a more active vacation, on foot.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              The beaches are free, you can find your place under a tree and
                              enjoy your privacy.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>And yes, I could practice yoga and perform yoga poses anywhere.</p>

                        <p>
                            My sister's great dream to visit the postcard village of Positano in
                            Italy became a reality last summer. It was not my dream destination
                            but I was so excited to see that famous village dramatically set
                            between rocks and surrounded by the Tyrrhenian sea.
                            <br>
                            So, we packed our bags and flew to Naples at the end of June. It
                            took us about one and half hour to get to Positano by taxi.
                          </p>
                    <p>
                            When we arrived at the hotel, we didn't want to waste a lot of time,
                            we were very excited to go down to the sun-bleached beach where
                            terracotta houses plunge into the turquoise sea. And yes, I must say
                            that this scenery left us breathless! This small cliffside village
                            on Mediterranean Sea is pure magic. Simply, wherever you turn your
                            view, there is an authentic beauty that cannot be described in
                            words. The best thing is that the commercial part (caffes,
                            restaurants, hotels) is beautifully blended in nature and
                            architecture. Nothing sticks out and, well, eh, I suppose it's
                            Italy! Every corner is breathtaking. Even, all those postcards
                            cannot convey this beauty.
                          </p>

                        <p>
                            We went on a road trip to Belgium last October, a two days
                            adventure. The idea was to stay in Ostend, a small place by the sea,
                            and from there to visit the nearby cities like: Calais, Dunkirk, Bruges, Ghent.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I love Ostend because it has a long, wide beach, which is quiet,
                            mostly empty in the off-season, there are only a few people walking
                            the dog, relaxing or jogging. <br>
                            Of course, as soon as we reached the beach, I was immediately
                            inspired, my passion was awakening and I found myself doing a quick
                            warm up before taking a few yoga pictures for my instagram.
                          </p>

                        <p>
                            The next day destinations were Dunkirk and Calais, small towns in
                            France, right on the border with Belgium. We arrived a little later,
                            walked around towns and then went to see sunset on the Calais beach.
                            Of course, a strong call of nature was there again... Magic always
                            happens when yoga meets a beautiful place. Once again I had amazing
                            photos. Those of the beach golden hour.
                          </p>
