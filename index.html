                    <p>I was born and raised in Serbia. I graduated from the University of Belgrade, I have a master&apos;s degree in geography and spatial planning. It was something I wanted to do as a job, but the circumstances of my life decided differently. I worked for 5 years at Belgrade airport as a home stewardess, after which I left my job to move to Germany. I&apos;ve been living in Germany for last three years. I am currently studying web development and I want it to be my future career.</p>
                    <p>I&apos;m a life enthusiast and a dreamer, I live everyday with gratitude and no expectation! I love my family, my little animal kingdom, yoga, healthy food, traveling..!</p>
                    <p>I started my yoga journey at a stressful period of my life, in 2019 and this was the best decision that helped me on my way to healing, which continues to this day...!

                <h3>Serifos</h3>
                <p>My wish has been for years to visit two or more (as many as possible) small Cycladic islands in a row, but circumstances have not yet allowed me to do so. But here we are, last summer I had the opportunity to fulfill at least a part of that dream and visit one for the first time, Serifos.</p>
                <p>It is a small island with some of the most beautiful beaches found on the Aegean Sea coast The island villages have been built in traditional Cycladic style, following the local architectur The old small houses in white-washed color, with blue window frames give a special charm to this magical place.</p>
                <p>Although I have never visited the typical, fancy islands like Santorini and Mykonos (and I believe they are amazingly beautiful), I am somehow convinced that I would always choose to visit the smaller ones. The main reason is that the smaller islands are quieter, not noisy and overcrowded with tourists, with non-dazzling white houses, freshly painted for the needs of high tourism like in Santorini etc.</p>
                <p>In Serifos, you can simply feel that local spirit, pthe domestic atmosphere, you simply have that magical feeling as if you were in the '60s and &apos;70s of the last century. Peace, presence of local tourists with a small number of foreign tourists, old houses, simplicity of unique architecture, unorganized beaches with tree lines as a natural shelter from the sun free for everyone, greek tourists with sunbeds and chairs spread out...</p>
                <p>Huge advantages: the island is small, very well connected by bus lines. Almost every beautiful beach can be reached by mini-bus or even better for a more active vacation, on foot. The beaches are free, you can find your place under a tree and enjoy your privacy. And yes, I could practice yoga and perform yoga poses anywhere.</p>
                <p>I really enjoyed Serifos and I wouldn&apos;t mind spending the rest of my life there.</p>
